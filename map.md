The map below shows all the countries in Europe. By clicking on those countries,
you are able to dig deeper into the political nationalism in that country. On
the left, some general stats are shown on the presence of nationalist parties
in the country and on the right, a small network detail shows the connections
those parties have with other parties and known fascist movements.

Use the
**dropdowns** to select what meaning the colors and the size or the nodes in the
network have. The colors can be used to show differentiate between countries,
nationalist parties and fascist movements or algorithmically found communities
of entities (more on that on [network](/network) page). Use the size to get a feel for
the importance of the nodes in the network. Select *in degree* to see how many
nodes link *to* that party or *out degree* to show how many other nodes are linked to
*from* node. *Betweennes Centrality* is a measure of how important a node is
within a network in terms of *information flow* (more about that on [network](/network)
page).
